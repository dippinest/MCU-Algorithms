<img src="/resources/logo.png" alt="MCU Cross-Platform Algorgitms logo"/>

___

#### Among them:

- Algorhithms for working with numeric data and converting numbers of various types into a string representation

- Algorhithms for filtering data

- Checksum calculation algorhithms (CRC)

- Implementation of the PID controller algorhithm

- Implementation of an algorhithm for calculating the temperature of an NTC thermistor

- Cryptographic algorhithms

- as well as overrides of C/C++ data types and some macros that simplify working with data

___

#### As examples of the algorhithms, the implementations of test programs for AVR microcontrollers (avr-gcc compiler) are given.
